#+DESCRIPTION Describes the .ND format

// Comments like this on their own line. //Partial line comments are not yet supported

We borrow heavily from org-mode's .org file format definition, but with some modifications to make things easier and better suited for flexible node-based time tracking and project management solutions.

For simplicity's sake, we keep the heading and paragraph formats, as well as using # marks to designate machine-readable code. An '=>' signifies that everything following it is generated by the program and should not be altered by the user.

All entries in this file may be thought of as widgets. Headings, text, lists, comments, properties, functions and hashtags are all different kinds of widgets. Of these, only functions can be extended.

Examples of headings:

* A Heading
** Sub Heading
*** Sub Sub Heading

// All #tag tags are included when in a paragraph widget, but not in comments
#tag1 #tag2 #tag3 

* Properties

Properties are formatted as #+PROPERTY_NAME: text_property_1, property_2, 102

Title is globally indexed, and should make efforts to be uniquely named, returns whether that is true
#+TITLE: test_piece => true

Nicknames are locally referenced, returns whether it is unique locally
#+NICKNAMES: nickname_uno nickname_the_second => true false

// Some properties might be auto generated with => signifying output from a machine. Don't edit this yourself!
#+DATECREATED: => 2021/04/07-2054.30

* Inter Node Links

// Allow specific links to other nodes, link types and descriptions
[[NODE_ID]]
[[NODE_ID][LINK_TYPE]]
[[NODE_ID or NICKNAME or TITLE][LINK_TYPE][LINK_DESCRIPTION]]

* Functions

// Functions are names and take a string as input (up to newline or =>), and return an output (after a =>). All take a JSON string for input and output a JSON string. This is for convenience right now, but might change in the future

#+FUNCTION {"input": "JSON Input", "next_data": "Yes, this is valid input"} => {"output": "Result or computation from a function"}

// Multiline functions start with #+BEGIN_ and end with #+END_
// Backlinks are implemented as a function. This is a list of all the nodes that refer to this node and how
#+BEGIN_BACKLINKS 
=> 
{
  LINK_TYPE: [NODE_ID_1, NODE_ID_2]
}
#+END_BACKLINKS

* Clocking

// A method of keeping track of work. Appended at end of file while being used
#+CLOCKIN {"date_created": "2021/04/07-2051:10"}

#+CLOCKOUT {"date_created": "2021/04/07-2052:12"}

// CLOCK widget takes sequential clockin->clockout times to estimate duration. Recursion allows it to look at all locally linked nodes.
#+CLOCK {"recursive": true, "link_types": ["session"], "max_session_time":"15m"} => {"duration": "1m2s"}


* Todo list tracking

// #+TODO is a widget that marks this node as something to do. Incomplete tasks are analysed programmatically (with no file writing), but completed items are added as a new entry in the output json
// Can have a repeat property which will periodically alert new events
// Node session templates may be used to record progress and time on a discrete session or task
#+BEGIN_TODO {"description": "Write up my todo list", "date_created": "2021/04/07-2051:10", "repeat":null, "node_template":NODE_ID} 
=> 
{
  "completed_flag": true, 
  "sessions": [
    // A session property is created in the TODO when a TODO is completed
    {"session":NODE_ID, "date_completed":2021/04/07-2351:10}
  ]
}
#+END_TODO

// Todo lists go through nodes and compile a list of all todo widgets
#+BEGIN_TODOLIST {"recursive": true, "link_types": ["child"]} =>
{
  "todo_nodes":[[NODE_ID_1, WIDGET_NUM_1, "todo description"], [NODE_ID_1, WIDGET_NUM_2, "todo description 2"]],
  "complete_nodes":[[NODE_ID_2, WIDGET_NUM_3, "todo description 3"]],
  "todo_count":2,
  "complete_count":1,
}

#+END_TODOLIST

// Lists can be unordered or ordered. They can be nested with spaces. They can have check boxes
- List item 1
- [ ] list item 2 with a checkbox
- [x] list item 3 with a marked checkbox
1. List 2 item 1
2. List 2 item 2
  - Sub list
